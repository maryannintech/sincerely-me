# ðŸ’Œ Sincerely, Me

A digital letter-writing platform that allows you to send messages to your future self. Write about your current thoughts, dreams, and experiences, then schedule them to be delivered at a later date.

## ðŸ“® Project Evolution

This project is the full realization of the concept introduced in my [coming soon page](https://github.com/maryannintech/coming-soon-page) - my first project using Tailwind CSS. What started as a simple landing page as now grown into a complete, functional web application. The coming soon page served as the foundation for the design language and user experience you see today.

## ðŸŽ¯ Development Purpose

This project was created as a learning exercise to practice full-stack development skills. While fully functional, I've chosen not to deploy this application publicly as it serves as a personal portfolio piece demonstrating my capabilities with React, Supabase, and modern web development practices. The focus was on building a complete, polished application from concept to implementation.
