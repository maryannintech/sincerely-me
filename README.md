# ðŸ’Œ Sincerely, Me

A digital letter-writing platform that allows you to send messages to your future self. Write about your current thoughts, dreams, and experiences, then schedule them to be delivered at a later date.

The coming soon page served as the foundation for the design language and user experience you see today.
